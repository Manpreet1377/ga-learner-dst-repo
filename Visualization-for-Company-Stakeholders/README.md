### Project Overview
Use matplotlib library in python to visualize company stats inn a comprehensive way. 
After completing this project, I got a better understanding of various data visualization techniques. In this project, I applied the following concepts:
1. Bar plotting
2. Scatter plotting
3. Kernel Density plotting
4. Subplot operations
5. Axes modifications

The following were the major steps involved in the project:

STEP 1: Visualizing Company's records wrt loan approvals

STEP 2: Loan approval distribution across the regions

STEP 3: To find out whether higher education results in a better guarantee in issuing loans

STEP 4: To check whether being graduate or not leads to different loan amount distribution

STEP 5: To find a correlation between the borrower's income and loan amount he is lent
