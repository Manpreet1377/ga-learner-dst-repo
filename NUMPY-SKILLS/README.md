### Project Overview:

Census record management and data analysis using NumPy skills.


### Learnings from the project:

After completing this project, I have a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, I applied the following concepts:
Array Appending
Array Slicing
Array Filtering
Array Aggregation

### Approach taken to solve the problem:

The 5 main steps in this project were:
1) To load the data to a numpy array and add a new record to it.
2) We often associate the potential of a country based on the age distribution of the people residing there. So I did a simple analysis of the age distribution to find the same
3) The constitution of the country tries it's best to ensure that people of all races are able to live harmoniously. So I checked the country's race distribution to identify the minorities so that the government can help them.
4) As per the new govt. policy, all citizens above age 60 should not be made to work more than 25 hours per week. So I analysed the data to check whether the government's policy is being followed or not.
5) We have generalized that we need to study well in order to get a good higher-paying job. So I did an analysis to see whether the hypothesis is true or false.
