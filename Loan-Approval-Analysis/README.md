### Project Overview:
Dream Housing Finance Inc. specializes in home loans across different market segments - rural, urban and semi-urban. Their loan eligibility process is based on customer details provided while filling an online application form. To create a targeted marketing campaign for different segments, they have asked for a comprehensive analysis of the data collected so far.

### Learnings from the project:
After completing this project, I got  a better grip on working with pandas. In this project I applied the following concepts.
1. Dataframe slicing
2. Dataframe aggregation
3. Pivot table operations

### Approach taken to solve the problem:
The following major steps were taken to solve the project:

STEP 1: To check which variable is categorical and which one is numerical to get a basic idea about the features of the bank dataset

STEP 2: To check which columns have missing values and also check the count of missing values each column has. If the columns have missing values, then fill them

STEP 3: To check loan amount of an avg person based on Gender, marriage status and employment status

STEP 4: To check percentage of loan approved based on a person's employment type

STEP 5: To find applicants with long loan amount term
